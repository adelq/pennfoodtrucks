In contrast to the editor&#39;s review, I find the food to be better quality than any of the local buffets, though Indian food in Philadelphia seriously lacks. This is the best of the mediocre options on campus IMO. A better option is Kabobeesh at 42nd and Chestnut.

Downsides are the truck is slow (everything is cooked to order of course), there&#39;s no call ahead number, the owner can be gruff, and there&#39;s no naan bread option--just thick pita bread.",3.2,4,3,3,4,2,1,"165.123.194.242",0

Sure, the owner is a bit gruff and doesn&#39;t do anything made-to-order except for mild/medium/spicy.

The spicy noodle platters are my favorite. I think this truck deserves special mention for making some of the best vegetarian food on campus. The japchae bap (noodles and vegetables with rice) or tofu noodle platter are massive portions of spicy goodness.

My only complaints are that the kimchi is radish kimchi and it&#39;s very mild for Americans. Also, the rice platters use a lot of cabbage for filler, so you end up with not so much meat.

The Friday special went up to $4.50 per platter after 3pm but it&#39;s still well worth it. Oh yeah, they have Japanese food too, which is okay if you want your food a lot blander and sweeter. I don&#39;t understand the obsession with kimbap, but if pickled radish sushi is your thing, pick some up for lunch on a Friday!

Why mess around? I just get the falafel platter to have 6 of them all to myself.

Overall I think the middle eastern food here is the best in the city. Amazing (depressing?) that it is from a food truck.

I was very surprised, even with the super long line, I didn&#39;t wait more than 10 minutes, and my order was put together in less than 1 minute.

I&#39;m sure they have loads of great dishes, but I wanted to try something that I&#39;ve never seen anything like before. So, I went with the seitan grinder. The flavor was nice, if a little bland (do not skip the hot sauce, it&#39;s not super hot and without it, the sandwich may have no flavor at all). And, the pita gets way too soggy. On the plus side, the veggies inside were very nice, warmed through but not mushy.(If you&#39;ve never had it before, seitan is made from wheat gluten and looks a lot like roast beef. The flavor is very mild, hardly even noticeable with the other flavors of the sandwich and mostly masked by the sesame seeds they put on it.)

The food is difficult, no impossible, to eat, though. I&#39;m glad I took mine home because I emptied the contents of my pita and ate it more like a salad with pita bread on the side. The flimsy, little plastic forks really don&#39;t help all that much. I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting a sandwich here if you&#39;ve got somewhere to go afterward...you&#39;ll probably end up with it all over your shirt.

The 84 percent that are not upgrading are also purchasing the cheapest smartphones around and there is no such thing as enthusiast bargain hunter when it comes to technology. Also, for this 84 percent, a smartphone is waaay too much phone for them, and most likely they are chasing to keep up with technology or just cannot see standard buttons on the lil cell phones IMO.I get that an update for software is extremely hardware relevant, as in if you don\\&#39;t have the hardware to support the feature it doesn\\&#39;t work. I get that Microsoft needed to restructure the OS completely and leave WP7 behind. But under false pretenses .I have read they knew it was dead before they released it and were working on WP8 at the same time. Its like they were launching with VHS when the DVDs were coming out next month. However, I don\\&#39;t think its fair that they left the early adopters high and dry without some compensation other than a flashy new start screen. I purchased the WP7 with the understanding that Microsoft was going to at least bother to advertise. And now with Windows 8 on the way it all makes sense. Bundled advertising for the whole Windows 8 line of desktop, tablet and phone makes for a pretty slick campaign, but that doesn\\&#39;t change the fact that I believed in Microsoft to show some love like 2 years ago. I have already dealt with fact that WP7 is last to have companies build apps (if at all) and now choking on the probability of these companies building WP8 only apps that I have been waiting for and cannot use on my antiquated OS.

I mean if one is in a professional environment, the whole environment projects professionalism, care, attention to detail, and most importantly attention to the patient.Esprit de corps creates professionalism and styles of behavior and concern which makes the patient feel at ease in a difficult situation.I also think that one should not use the white coat or the gloves to make the patient feel that the situation is more complicated than it is.  Some informality is important especially in take home instructions.  Common sense is too.  Obviously, infection control and hygiene are critical.But I remember diagnosing a tuberculosis infected HIV infected physician.  The physician was clearly in denial.  He was seeing patients while coughing and losing weight.He coughed up a sixteen ounce cup of sputum during his visit with me.  I was afraid that I would convert my PPD since we did not do the protocol of isolation and UV light immediately.  But, on the other hand, I decided to do everything in the clinic before he went to the ward.  We got a microscopic sputum diagnosis of AFB before he left his cubicle.  That simplified his work up on the floor and he was immediately sent to where he needed to be.  Working in an inner city hospital, I was told when entering the patient\\&#39;s room by the supervisory physician that he did not believe in the physician\\&#39;s weight loss and symptoms.The important thing is to listen to the patient and address the medical issue at hand.  Messages are important but only part of the picture.  Even mistakes can lead to positive results if one addresses the patient respectfully.  I remember a thirty something patient coming in for a flu shot in a year that there was a scarcity and the indications were for people over sixty five and with extraordinary conditions.  This patient looked healthy and I immediately told him that he looked too healthy to get a flu shot.  He took off his hat and he had an IV line in place for chemotherapy for a brain tumor.  So, I congratulated him on well he looked under the circumstances and that he had fooled me; the patient was pleased even though I had clearly spoken too quickly.Perhaps, the point that brings these two cases to mind is that the intention of the doctor conveys the message as well as the natural symbolism.  The unexpected can happen at any moment.  One should first worry about what needs to be done and do to right by the patient rather than simply worry about the impression.Bohdan A Oryshkevich, MD, MPH",2.2,5,1,2,1,2,1,"78.9.150.49",0

Their General Tso is not spicy at all and tastes like they threw cups of sugar into it. The rice is mediocre at best and the entire dish drenched in watery sauce. In terms of convenience, Kim\\&#39;s is good. But besides that I wouldn\\&#39;t waste your time or money here.   ",2.6,1,4,4,1,3,1,"165.123.220.39",0
